# Decentralized-Lottery-Application
My first Blockchain technology project using Solidity programming language.
Basically at least 3 participants are required in this lottery system and manager/owner have the full control over whole lottery application.
Manager can check balance, select winner and transfer money to the winner blockchain wallet address.
Winner is chosen randomly by system generated code.
Once the winner is declared, the whole lottery system reset itself making a fresh start again.
Minimum 1 ethereum is required to send to smart contract if anyone want to participate in this lucky/lottery draw system.
